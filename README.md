Simple role to install httpd server on ubuntu with custom page

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      become: true
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
